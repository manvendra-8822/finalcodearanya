            Planting of same crops again and again has led to depletion of essential nutrients from the soil. This has
            led to excessive use of chemicals, but a natural way to prevent this is by implementing crop rotation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Crop rotation is the practice of planting different crops sequentially on the same plot of land to prevent
            depletion of same nutrients and to naturally replenish the soil.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here farmers will be advised on which crops to plant and then the crops harvested will be entered according
            to which the points will be awarded which can be redeemed later.
        </p>
        <p>
            We want the soil to naturally replenish rather than leaving it barren or using chemical fertilizers to
            replenish it. so we do it by crop rotation
